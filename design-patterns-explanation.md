# Design Patterns and Overengineering in Software Development

## Design Patterns Explained

### 1. Factory Pattern
**Concept:** 
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to change the type of objects that will be created. It wraps object creation , which makes the code more maintainable.

**Example in Our Pizza System:**
```python
class PizzaFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_pizza(pizza_type):
        if pizza_type == "Margherita":
            return MargheritaPizza()
        elif pizza_type == "Pepperoni":
            return PepperoniPizza()
```

### 2. Singleton Pattern
**Concept:**
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access to it. 

**Example in Our Pizza System:**
```python
class InventoryManager:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(self):
        if InventoryManager._instance is None:
            InventoryManager._instance = object.__new__(InventoryManager)
            InventoryManager._instance._inventory = {...}
        return InventoryManager._instance
```

### 3. Strategy Pattern
**Concept:**
The Strategy Pattern groups different methods, keeps each one separate, and allows them to be swapped easily.

**Example in Our Pizza System:**
```python
class PaymentStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount: float):
        pass

class PayPalPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def pay(self, amount: float):
        print(f"Paid ${amount} using PayPal.")
```

## Overengineering:

### What is Overengineering?
Overengineering occurs when a solution is unnecessarily complex, adding more functionality or abstraction than required which leads to:
- Increased development time
- Reduced code readability
- Unnecessary complexity

### Potential Overengineering in Our Pizza System

#### 1. Excessive Abstraction Example
**Overengineered Approach:**
```python
class AbstractPaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def validate_payment(self, amount: float):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def process_transaction(self, amount: float):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def generate_receipt(self, amount: float):
        pass

class PayPalPayment(AbstractPaymentProcessor):
    def validate_payment(self, amount: float):
        pass

    def process_transaction(self, amount: float):
        pass

    def generate_receipt(self, amount: float):
        pass
```

**Problem:**
- Adds extra complexity
- Creates unnecessary overhead for simple payments
- Increases development and maintenance time
- Makes the code harder to read
