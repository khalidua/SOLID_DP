# Design Patterns and the Pitfalls of Overengineering

## Design Patterns Explained

### 1. Decorator Pattern
**Concept**: A structural design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects.

**Example in Pizza System**:
```python
# Base Pizza Interface
class Pizza(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_description(self):
        pass

# Decorator Wrapper
class ToppingDecorator(Pizza):
    def __init__(self, pizza: Pizza):
        self._pizza = pizza

# Concrete Decorator
class Cheese(ToppingDecorator):
    def get_description(self):
        return f"{self._pizza.get_description()} + Cheese"

    def get_cost(self):
        return self._pizza.get_cost() + 1.0
```

### 2. Singleton Pattern
**Concept**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Example in Inventory Management**:
```python
class InventoryManager:
    _instance = None
    _inventory = {}

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

### 3. Strategy Pattern
**Concept**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

**Example in Payment Processing**:
```python
class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount: float) -> None:
        pass

class PayPalPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount: float) -> None:
        print(f"Paid ${amount:.2f} using PayPal.")
```

## Overengineering: A Detailed Exploration

### What is Overengineering?
Overengineering is the practice of designing a product, system, or solution that is more complicated than necessary to meet its requirements. It often stems from:
- Anticipating future needs that may never arise
- Adding unnecessary complexity
- Using design patterns without clear justification

### Potential Overengineering Scenarios in Our Pizza Ordering System

#### 1. Unnecessary Abstraction
**Overengineered Example**:
```python
# Overengineered approach
class AbstractPizzaFactory:
    def create_base_pizza(self) -> Pizza:
        pass
    
    def create_topping_strategy(self) -> ToppingStrategy:
        pass
    
    def create_pricing_calculator(self) -> PricingCalculator:
        pass

class ComplexPizzaFactory(AbstractPizzaFactory):
    def create_base_pizza(self) -> Pizza:
        # Overly complex pizza creation
        pass
    
    def create_topping_strategy(self) -> ToppingStrategy:
        # Unnecessary strategy for topping selection
        pass
    
    def create_pricing_calculator(self) -> PricingCalculator:
        # Overly complicated pricing mechanism
        pass
```

**Problems with This Approach**:
- Adds unnecessary layers of abstraction
- Increases complexity without providing clear benefits
- Makes the code harder to understand and maintain

#### 2. Premature Generalization
**Overengineered Example**:
```python
# Overly generalized payment processing
class AbstractPaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, 
                 transaction_logger, 
                 fraud_detector, 
                 currency_converter, 
                 payment_validator):
        self._logger = transaction_logger
        self._fraud_detector = fraud_detector
        self._converter = currency_converter
        self._validator = payment_validator
    
    def process_payment(self, amount, currency):
        # Extremely complex payment processing
        pass
```

**Problems with This Approach**:
- Adds unnecessary dependencies
- Increases system complexity
- Creates tight coupling between components
- Adds processing overhead for simple transactions

### How to Avoid Overengineering

#### 1. Follow YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Only add complexity when absolutely necessary
- Implement features when they are actually required
- Avoid speculative generality

#### 2. Keep It Simple (KISS Principle)
- Start with the simplest solution that meets current requirements
- Add complexity incrementally as needed
- Regularly refactor and simplify code

#### 3. Use Design Patterns Judiciously
- Apply design patterns with clear purpose
- Understand the problem before applying a pattern
- Consider the trade-offs of added complexity

### Warning Signs of Overengineering
- Code is difficult to understand
- Multiple layers of abstraction with no clear benefit
- Methods and classes that are never fully utilized
- Excessive use of design patterns without solving real problems
- Anticipating feature requirements that don't exist

## Conclusion
Design patterns are powerful tools when used appropriately. The key is to balance complexity with simplicity, always focusing on solving the current problem efficiently and maintainably.
