# SOLID Principles and Design Patterns Analysis

## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Decorator Pattern
**Implementation**: Used in the pizza topping system
- Location: `ToppingDecorator` and its subclasses (`Cheese`, `Olives`, `Mushrooms`)
- How it works: Dynamically adds additional responsibilities to pizzas without modifying their core classes

**SOLID Principle Adherence**:
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: 
  - Allows extending pizza functionality without modifying existing pizza classes
  - New toppings can be added without changing base pizza implementations
  - Example: Adding `Mushrooms` topping doesn't require changing `MargheritaPizza` or `PepperoniPizza`

### 2. Singleton Pattern
**Implementation**: Used in `InventoryManager`
- Location: `InventoryManager` class with `__new__` method override
- How it works: Ensures only one instance of inventory manager exists throughout the application

**SOLID Principle Adherence**:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: 
  - `InventoryManager` has a single responsibility of managing inventory
  - Centralizes inventory tracking and modification
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
  - Provides a centralized point of inventory management
  - Other components depend on abstraction (inventory management) rather than concrete implementation

### 3. Strategy Pattern
**Implementation**: Used in payment methods
- Location: `PaymentMethod` abstract base class and concrete implementations (`PayPalPayment`, `CreditCardPayment`)
- How it works: Allows selecting different payment strategies at runtime

**SOLID Principle Adherence**:
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
  - New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code
  - Example: Adding a new payment method like `BitcoinPayment` won't require changes to existing payment logic
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
  - All payment methods can be used interchangeably
  - Each payment method adheres to the `PaymentMethod` contract

### 4. Abstract Factory Pattern (Partial Implementation)
**Implementation**: Abstract base classes (`Pizza`, `PaymentMethod`)
- Location: `Pizza` ABC and `PaymentMethod` ABC
- How it works: Provides a blueprint for creating families of related objects

**SOLID Principle Adherence**:
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
  - High-level modules depend on abstractions
  - Concrete implementations depend on abstract interfaces
  - Enables flexibility in creating different types of pizzas and payment methods

## Key SOLID Principle Highlights

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- `Pizza` handles pizza descriptions and costs
- `InventoryManager` manages inventory
- `PaymentMethod` handles payment processing

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- System is open for extension but closed for modification
- New features can be added through inheritance and composition
- Example: Adding new toppings or payment methods without changing existing code

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes
- `MargheritaPizza` and `PepperoniPizza` can be used interchangeably
- Payment methods can be used without breaking the application logic

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Interfaces are designed to be minimal and focused
- `get_description()` and `get_cost()` methods are specific and concise
- Abstract base classes have minimal, essential methods

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Concrete implementations depend on abstract interfaces
- Allows for loose coupling and easier maintenance
